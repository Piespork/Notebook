- It is now time to work on module 3, creating a world for our models. Or placing our model into a world. I have decided to continue with my original idea from module 2 and create a twitter bot for my model fish!
- An important thing to note is that I am NOT using my model from module 2 (Fish Guevara), mainly because I love the idea of just having the fish but also because I dont want to upset anyone. I'd prefer getting through university without having people be mad at something i've made. 
- As of March 4th, 2018, https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/CubaFactBot is my current bot's 'code'
- The main idea for my twitter bot is to research cuban 'facts'. These can range from pictures to common facts to sketchfab models. There is TONS of room to add other things!
- Basic reply functions are also added. I figured adding a 'help' option with the list of reply commands would best suit anyone who wants to get a reply out of the bot. Again, there is TONS of room for improvement.
- By continuing off of my current twitter bot I am able to improve many aspects as well as further understand how it relates to my model. Why exactly does the 'tiwtterverse' constitute a world that my model can be placed in? How is my model used?
- Something funny to note is that I named my bot 'Ernesto', based off of male Cuban names. This is also the real name of Che Guevara. I only found that out AFTER making the bot while researching cuban facts. It made it all the better when i decided in module 2 to mash up my fish model with Che. Ernesto meets Ernesto!
