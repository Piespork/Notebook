# Reflection (evidence of active listening and attention)

- As I started the class I had no idea what to expect. A smaller class size filled with similar minds who had no idea what they signed up for.
And i couldnt be happier. So far the class has taught me many things, mostly with the procedure and identity of technology and how it affects history.
For example, how 3D-modeling has helped archeology by providing unique ways of capturing enviroments, bodies, etc (and perhaps even stamped bricks). 
 
- However, we also learned digital history is complicated. It is not simply cut and dry, take some scans and be done with it. When talking about scanning dead bodies is there a line being crossed? Are there ethical accounts for how the bodies should be treated? Many questions come up, and rightly so, as this new era of technology introduces digital identities. What this makes me believe is that we must remain mindful that because the field is so new, there are many directions to go and we must stay vigilant on keeping things safe. We cannot put the cart infront of the horse. 

- Perspective is a very large theme i've found myself thinking about as we continue the lectures and reading. No longer do I see a statue and think "cool", I think about the history and the procedure. Someone may have taken a scan of someone, put it up somewhere digitaly, then printed it, and copied it, and etc. So many different directions that objects, models, and paintings can go. We talk often about copies of object and if they hold value (I believe they do, and that we can give any object a certain value, subjectivly). With the digital era giving us so much new technology to play with, the question of copies will surely be a topic that people come back to. 

- The 'non-meeting' we had was a fantastic way to discuss topics that we actually wanted to discuss. The idea that we can go off into a certain group and just talk is a great way for people to actualy TALK. In my group we had discussed video games and education. This allowed us to take what we had talked about in class and see how video games manage historical data. By applying what we've learned we were able to open up about several issues ranging from historical accuracies in Assassins Creed, to pandemic modeling in World of Warcraft. 

- Overall, the class has been a blast. I hope that the rest of the class feels the same way, and i hope we continue to learn and open our minds to how technology and history come together.
