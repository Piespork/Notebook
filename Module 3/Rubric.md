# Grading Rubric

- For this module we are to make our own rubric for grading. I personally have a little trouble with self-grading, but it also allowed me to better understand how i should approach the project.
It let me focus on the key aspects in which I think make module 3 important. 
- I'll be following closely to the original rubric from past modules because I believe they include what makes the project successful.

- The rubric will be broken down into 4 parts: Process notes, Paradata, Colaborating class lectures / readings with the project, and passive vs. active narrative.


|   |1   |2   |3   |4  |5   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Process Notes   |Very few notes made   |Moderate notes, but not engaging|Moderate notes, slightly engaging|Solid amount of notes, slightly engaging|Solid amount of notes, engaging   |
|Paradata   |Unclear why project choices were made   |Slightly clear why project choices were made|Clear why project choices were made, lack of connection with course material|Clear why project choices were made, some connection with course material|Clear why project choices were made, great connection with course material |
|Colaboration |Doesnt incorporate course material properly|Decent connection between course material and readings / project|Moderate connection between course material and readings / project   |Solid connection between course material and readings / project|Great connection between course material and readings / project   |
|Passive vs Active   |No attepmt at different narratives|Passive (or active) narrative clearly present|Both narratives present, but lacking|Both narratives present, more ephasis on one|Both narratives present, both equally included into project environment|

- Based on the rubric above I have given myself marks our of 5 for each section
- Process notes: 5/5
- Paradata: 4/5
- Colaboration: 5/5
- Passive vs Active: 4/5

- Total: 18/20

- I believe I was engaged with the material and was properly able to make connections between what my project was about, and why the choices were made.
However, I believe I could have done more. With some creative instincts I could have opened up more room for better narrtives and made the active narrative more engaging.
I also believe I could have explained my choices a bit better. Overall I'm quite happy with how the project turned out and how I was able to take the reading that focused on narratives and apply it to the twitterbot.
The use of narratives is very important for how someone will engage with a subject.
