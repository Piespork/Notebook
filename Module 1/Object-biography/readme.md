# Object Biography

- The model is of an antique wooden fish. The fist itself comes from northern Cuba, handcrafted by a street merchant. 
- The model was bought in 2010 for roughly 15$ canadian.
- Not much can be said about the origins of the material, ie. the wood.
- The paint would be standard coloring paint.
- The merchant who created the sculpture was a local of the area, just a simple man making sculptures to make money to live off of. 
- The interesting thing to note is that the merchant whom made the fish would have no idea that this particular fish would be sent to Ottawa, Ontario. Then the fish would be used for a project in which it would be digitized and historically saved. The merchant would have no idea his sculpture would be used in such a new, innovative way, or that in fact some 23 year old would be talking about the fish years later.
