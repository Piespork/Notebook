# Back and Forth

- Class on February 14th changed my direction for the 2nd module. Originally I had wanted to mash up my fish model with a Che Guevera model.
However, due to issues with MeshMixer, I shifted into altering my model's data into sound.
- Thanks to a fellow student in the class, I shifted back into my original idea of mashing models together. He introduced me to a new program,
which is actually built into Windows 10. The program is called 3D Builder.
- 3D Builder is not as sophisticated as Blender, MeshLab, or Meshmixer; however, its simplicity allows for jumping right in without a need for tutorials.
- When it came to mashing the two models together I decided that keeping the critical elements of Che Guevera was important. The reason for this is simply because he is a well known historical figure.
- With that in mind, I used the splitting tool to cut my ish into two seperate parts. First I cut the fish's head off. Having a solid head would allow me to change its size, seperate from the other part of the fish.
- Next I cut the tail off. The tail will go onto the back of Che's head, making a sort of 'sandwich'. Having the tail seperate also allows me to size it properly.
- With both sections of the fish, the next step is altering the size to fit onto the Che model. After adjusting the size, I was able to combine the head (and then the tail) with the Che model, creating a single model.
- With a solid model I am able to change its size, export as an .obj, etc. I now have a mashed up "Fish Guevera".
- As a final note, I placed the newly mashed up model back on sketchfab, quite happy with the results.
