# Augmented Reality - Using the Senses

- This week we were given a small list of videos and readings that shows different uses of augmented reality. One theme i noticed while watching
and reading was that of senses. Augmented reality looks to bridge other senses in with digital technology. This makes sense because it is often
the case where vision and hearing are only used by technology. However, touch, taste and smell are 3 important senses that can be used!
- Touch is an interesting sense with augmented reality because we often have to 'fake' the sense. That is, augmented reality only gives the perception
of something being there, so it has to be immserive enough to be believable.
- Smell was used interestingly, with a device attached to send different smells depending on location. While the devicee would be obviously noticed,
there is a certain immsersive feeling that naturally comes from smelling something. It is an interesting use of the sense, and still very new.
We should expect to see some developments for augmented and virtual reality in this field, to increase immersion.
- Overall the focus was to immerse the user as much as possible, bringing the digital to the real. The more likely someone doesn't realize that they are
using augmented realiy, the more likely they will be immsersed. 
- There is of course some downsides to augmented reality. In the case of Pokemon GO, people seemed to ignore reality while driving and walking, either getting
into accidents or injuring themselves. So while they were for sure immersed, they took it too far. Some people believe that things like Pokemon
GO can make people not enjoy the real world, and focus too much on the virtual. 
- I believe the interaction of the virual and the real is the future. People will continue to develop new things that can be found all over the world.
The benefits is increased interaction between people and history/the world, but as of now they still require a screen to be the medium to enjoy it.
I look forward to see how new innovations in this field continue to help immerse people.

# 3D-Printing
- With Module 4 we are tasked with bringing our virtual objects into the real world. My idea that i am going with is to 3D-print my Fish Guevara
model I made in module 2. Thankfully Prof. Graham was nice enough to fund our models, and I have given the printing lab at my school the file to print.
It should take about a week for me to get my model, the next step with it should be deciding how I want to go forward. I may make a small scene
that includes the model. My idea for that is to make a 'beach' like scene to incorporate the Cuban theme. This could include the model being a statue
that has small people worshiping it. This could symbolize how people worship Che Guevara for being a freedom fighter. 
- One small issue I have run into is that the 3D-model i have sent to print isnt as detailed as I would like. I'll have to wait and see how it turns out,
but worst case I might be able to paint on some features.
