# Module 4 Reflection

- This module was all about the senses, and how different experiences can be had with the same material. For example, you are able to take a digital artifiact, which uses sight, and print a 3D-model, which uses touch. A lot of the questions revolved around "how does experiencing something with a different sense effect the overall interact? Does it add or take away from the original?"
- The readings we had done for this module focused on 2 key components: the senses and accuracy for reconstructing a historical landmark. The first group of readings followed different people test and experience how senses could be used for digital experiences. This could be artifical smells based on location, or hearing voices as you walk through a graveyard. These can add to arbitrary experiences, if done properly. This connects with the course as we try to create 'something', and that 'something' should impace an experience. With the digital it is often a screen that is used as a medium for experiences. However, following along with new technology, there is so much room for new experiences with the other senses. 
- The second readings focused on a reconstruction of a monument that was poorly done, and mostly poorly received. The intention of the 3D model of a destroyed arch was to see how people would react, and also to show the details they were able to create. However, the poor reception indicated that the work was not quite up to par. What i find most interesting is that the creators of the 3D-model truly believed the new arch to be high quality. I relate to this by thinking back to 1990's gamer magazines that would advertise graphics as being "realistic! The best ever!", but in actuality they are just okay (and now dated). Yes, the model is great for how new the technology is, but it leaves something to be desired. Therefore, the makers should not give up due to poor reception, but continue to take feedback and further the technology.
- Another important part of this module, if not this class in general, is the emphasis on new technology coming through and trying to create new experiences. Not all new tech will become popular and much of it will flop. The internet has opened up the way for anyone with an idea to create something, at any time. At this point it almost feels like "throwing something at the wall and seeing what sticks". We look at TONS of different forms of tech within this class that range from being useful, such as Meshmixer, and other tech that just seems to exist, such as turning images into sound. 
- Class discussions for this module were often focused on either the importance of having digital objects come back into the physical world, or the ethics that can arrise from new technology. Ethics plays into the use of all technology, especially newer tech that hasnt been fully explored. The effects tehcnology, and moving digital things into the physical world, could prove ethically wrong. Further research is needed to understand how ethics must be maintained.
