# Video Games and Aracheology
- Today we had a special guest: Andrew Reinhard. He was able to explain some key points of archeo-gaming. 
- We learned things are more complicated then they appear. One tricky aspect of archeo-gaming was trying to keep track of different game 
states; that is, the different versions. Because games are updated so often we tend to lose track of which version included what, and also 
what the original is like compared to the version that is out today. There are no tools right now like traditional archeology that can
help us with keeping records of video games. But one day maybe! As I type this I think it could be a fun little programming project. 
The best project with archeo-gaming I can think of is a way to track the distances of game worlds. Lord knows we need it.
- As we were talking about games today I had some ideas about my twitter bot for Module 3. One important thing to note is how the narratives
of my bot interact with the users. My twitterbot includes both a passive narrative and an active narrative. The passive narrative is simply 
that it'll tweet twice a day. The user is then able to just check twitter, see the twit, and move on. However, the active narrative lets
the user tweet AT the bot and have the bot tweet back. Right now the responses are failr limited, but they can always be improved!
- When it comes to my twitterbot tweeting back at someone with an active narrative I fall back into the trap of too many choices. There is a 
certain limit in which the effort to create new responses outweighs the actual gain of the responses. Therefore I must be careful not to waste my time.
- I'm also afraid that talking about games as much as we do will warp my mind on how I will play them. I love my video games. I really do.
So I hope that i wont be looking TOO much into how each one employs active and passive narratives, how things are recorded, how the game 
makes use of the world, etc. Sometimes I just want to enjoy my game damnit.
