# 3D Printed Model

- Last week I had sent in my STL file to be 3D printed for Module 4, fish Guevara was to be made! 
Yesterday he finished printed, and now he is brought into the physical world.
- He turned out great! One small issue is the lack of detail in the face, but because the model itself relied on the colour for detail,
the 3D printer could not provide the colour detail. So if I want my printed model to be detailed, i'll need to paint it myself. Unfortunatley 
I dont have the supplies or time to do it for module 4, but one day I may get around to it.
- I feel like its cheating a bit to have printed my model for module 4, as the amount of work is much less than the other modules. However,
I have more time to reflect on the choices made, espcially at possible problems that come with making Fish Guevara. 

# Random Tech
- Prof. Graham never ceases to amaze with the amount of random technology he throws at us, like a bunch of baby birds being fed. Today we had
the pleasure of looking at two pieces of technology: an image reader that looks at an image and plays sound that it thinks is related; and a
"planner" like technology that allows you to setup scenarios without physical equipment.
- The first tech that delt with images was fairly interesting. Being able to take a visual representation and turning it into sound is neat, but
taking an image and playing a sound that a computer THINKS is related is pretty cool. Sometimes it made sense, like a picture of many people sounding
like a busy street. However, a picture of skulls that sound like clocks, or water... is a bit weird. There could be some deeper meaning, or 
some problem with the algorithm. In any case, its pretty neat. 
- The 2nd piece of technology took me by surprise. A simple concept, but has an AMAZING amount of versitility. It takes creativity and matches
it with planning. It seems like a great first step at creating new technology and coming up with ideas for how to make things interact. I could
see it being a useful teaching tool, especially for children. It teaches logic and organization. Lots of possibilites!
