# Frustration. Good and Bad

# The Good.
- I managed to spend some time learning about Cuba, facts and basic bit of information. I found a few models on Sketchfab that I was able to use for the twitterbot.
- I managed to get the twitterbot itself working! Twice a day it will post a tweet.
- The twitterbot was created by the cheap bots done quick web-app. It was fairly simple after our group work.
- The twitter for the bot was pretty straightforward, i took a snapshot of my 3D-model for the profile picture and found a nice cuba picture for the header background.
- The bot also has some simple reply mechanics, a 'help' command will reply with a small list of other reply commands. 

# The Bad.
- There has been many many bad things.
- I was informed today that the twitterbot is not really for module 2, instead its more for module 3.
- This left me a small bit frustrated, as i now had to find a new project for module 2.
- My first idea left me with a mashup of two models (my fish and Poseidon). The idea was mashing a fish with the god of the sea.
- I found a few models on Sketchfab for Poseidon, but i changed my mind last minute and decided to go with something that would fit the Cuban theme.
- I found a great model of Che Guevera. My idea was to mash the fish model with Che, perhaps putting the fishes face and tail into Che's head.
- I mainly got the idea through todays lecture, and the ethical issues that we face with copies and alterations.
- I wondered if people would get mad at me potentially 'defacing' a rebel icon. Fish Guevera would live on though, as I liked the idea.
- I downloaded Meshmixer (although ran into a problem with Bad Image error, similar to many programs ive been having lately).
- After a few hours I found the problem was Visual Studio, so I downloaded a newer version (2017) and it seemed to fix my issue.
- Meshmixer was fairly straightforward, however I ran into a few snag. It seems that it likes crashing my computer. Frequently. 
- Everytime my computer would crash i would load meshmixer back up and continue my work (making sure to save often).
- I cut away the base of the fish model and transformed them together, making one single model.
- A few hours of trimming and perfecting the work, I was rather happy with the model (minus a few blips here and there)
- However, after almost completing my work my computer crashes again. This time though, it seemed to have deleted all my save data.
- After a few minutes of smashing a pillow into the bed due to frustration, I decided to go a different route. Perhaps sonifying the data would be interesting.
- I took the rest of the evening going through Prof. Grahams notes on the sonifying procedure, useing the Music Algorithms web-app to play around with the data.
- I was able to take some points and place them into the web-app, as per instructed.
- 3 Voices in the web-app, 18 notes each, and at 30 BPS, i found the sounds to be a bit creepy, but also love the pattern.
- I will continue working on sonifying the data later on, although im not quite sure what to do with the sounds after turning them into a midi file.
- I also tried working with audacity, as per Prof. Grahams idea. However, I find audacity a bit confusing as I have never used music / sound related software before.
- I will note that trying to learn so many new technologies can be... frustrating. I feel as if im barely scratching the surface into any of them.
- I wish we only had to learn 1 or 2, but i guess it serves to prove how complicated these processes can be. 
- My final ideas for the day is perhaps creating a very large data to put into the Music Algorithms web-app, to create a single, large piece of sound.
- I don't know if i'll be able to create a song however, as I believe that to be out of my abilities.
