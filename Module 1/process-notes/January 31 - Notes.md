# Blender: Somes wins, some losses.

- I began by learning how to use blender (the basics) from youtube tutorials
- For learning in a short amount of time, I feel rather confident in my abilities. Learning a new technology / software is always fun
- When I felt comfortable with blender, I imported my model and started fixing it up / cropping unneeded material
- The good news is I had created a wonderful looking model that I'm proud of!
- The bad news is the UV mapping. UV mapping is taking the texture and mapping it to the model.
- This process is NOT easy for complicated models, and I found it to be out of the scope of what I'm able to do.
- So while i have a nice 'blend' model that looks exactly how I want, it does not export properly because of the UV mapping
- I'll try and get meshlab to work this weekend, thankfully I do have an uncropped version of the model with textures / mtl / obj files
- So all is not lost! Just unfortunate that after all the work, UV mapping has stopped me from using the model I wanted.
- This coming weekend is when Module 1 is due, so my focus will be on the biography, metadata, peradata, etc. Just making sure everything is ready to go!
