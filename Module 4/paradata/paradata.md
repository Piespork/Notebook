# Choosing What To Make
- This Module had a large range of choices for what to do with our models: augmented reality, virtual reality, physical models, etc. The idea is to make something that not only brings the digital into the physical, but understand how it can engage with an audience. 
- The main focus is on the senses. The most common senses that are used with the digital medium is sight and hearing. This often leaves out other important senses like touch, taste, and smell. 
- When thinking about what I wanted to make I thought about focusing on one particular sense: touch. 
- Due to a busy schedule I chose to 3D-print my model using Carleton Universities services. This is the first time i've done 3D-printing but I now understand it's benefitis. Modeling something digital from clay, wood, stone, etc. can get it's likeness, but actually 3D-printing can get exact details that mimic it's digital counterpart.
- The 3D-printer uses a white plastic material to print. Therefore, the colours of my model are absent. 

# The Senses
- The major theme of this Module was on the senses, and how they can be used to change experiences. Some examples include walking through a graveyard with a rig that sends smells to the user, and augmented reality which allows another layer of interaction through a phone's screen by introducing digital objects to the real world. 
- My main objective was to take my digital object and introduce a new sense aside from sight. Smell, hearing, and taste were a little too 'out there' for the purposes of the project. This lead me to touch. By 3D-printing the mashed up model of Fish Guevara, audiences can now experience the digital model in the physical world.
- The use of touch lends a more 'real' identity to an object. Therefore, the senses play an important role in how objects can be interacted with. 

# Controversy?
- An important thought was brought up in our lectures on how printing an object and bringing it into the physical world can contain controversies. Bringing a simple fish model from the physical world into the digital is not particularly interesting. However, by using a beloved figure and mashing it together with something, it can lead to controversy. 
- Controversy is an interesting topic because it deals with context. North Americans might not care about South American or Asian tradition, and therefore controversial topics are alien. In the case of my model, Che Guevara is not as popular in Canada compared to Cuba, and therefore any changes made to his appearance will not have the same effect for Canadians. If I were to bring my model to Cuba, their reactions would certainly be different. So an important lesson is to put yourself in the shoes of the culture you're using for digital purposes. 
- When creating Fish Guevara I thought about issues of defacing a celebrated figure, but when I 3D-printed the model I got to experience it in another sense and better understood how it might be seen as disrespectful.  

# Differences Between Digial And Physical
- Having something be digital and physical is two completly differnt feelings. By having something be tangible you can introduce another sense and relationship with an object. Only seeing a digital object does not make it tangible, but feeling it in person does. 

# Final Thoughts
- By printing out my mashed model I was able to compare it to the original fish model. While my fish is way larger, the distinct detail similarities are quite surreal. 
- By printing out the model it is possible to effect many senses, especially compared to its digital counterpart. For example, scents can be added to the model to simulate things. It is also possible to print out the model using edible materials, which can impact the sense of taste. These types of differences can create new experiences that the digital medium cannot. 
- Is the new experience worth it? I believe it is. We are at a point with technology where we can create, mod, shape, remake, etc. where our imagination is the limit. Therefore, we can study how different experiences influence our decisions and motivations towards things. Seeing a 3D-model of Fish Guevara online could be a fleeting moment, but being able to hold it could imprint a memory, and therfore a lasting experience. 
- We discussed how museums had let the public hold and examine objects, instead of just looking. The museums encouraged experiencing objects in a different way to better understand them, similar to how we can print and hold digital objects. Therefore, I believe it is very important that we dont not stop at simply creating digital objects, but embrace them in as many itterations as possible. This will not degrade the object any less, but enhance the overall experience. By including ways of smelling, tasting, touching, hearing, and seeing something we can relate to things so much more.
