# Module 3 Reflection

- This module focused on video games and how they can be used as immersive environments. We made game a on Twine, 
had a guest lecturer, made ANOTHER game on twine, discussed how narratives impart information, and how the tools for archeo-gaming are
just being newly developed. 
- Something often found in the class is the idea that 'this stuff is new, so its not easy and its not always right'. This easily translates
to how video games are both made, and who they are made for. Do we make this game 100% historically accurate? Will people play it? Will
it be fun? These types of questions are asked when making games that involve history. Games that focus on accuracy and claim to be 100%
accurate (such as Kingdom Come: Deliverence), fall into issues when they bring their own political agenda into the creation. For this reason
we must be careful in believing historical accuracies in games.
- The inclusion of narratives was my favorite part of the module as I loved the idea of a passive vs active narrative. Passive narratives
are quite common in education, books, etc. The passive narrative is just a means of easily conveying information. The user does not have to
put much effort in, they usually dont become immersed, and they dont interact with the environment. Active narratives provide more ways
of taking information and doing something with it. It could be making the user do more work, touching or feeling something historical, or 
using other means to recieve information. As new technology is made the ways we can introduce active narratives expands. No longer do we need
to just read a book. Through augmented reality, video games, and virtual reality we can live the book. We can take information and expand on
the ideas, making enviornments that can even change how we interpret data. It is one thing to read about the pyramids, but to 'go visit' them
through virtual reality is another thing entirely.
- The rules and relationships behind immersive experienses are truly the bread and butter. We can throw differnt 'coats of paint' on the rules,
but things will be similar. However, just tweaking the rules and relationships can alter the experience entirely. Its because of this that 
graphics dont matter. It doesnt matter how pretty something is, if its engaging then thats whats important. 
- This module was great at making us think outside the box and really use our imaginiation. The twine games allowed us to take different tools
and concepts and apply them. Only limited to our imagination, we could what ever narratives and immersive techniques to use in our games and our
projects. I hope module 4 is equally as enjoyable.
