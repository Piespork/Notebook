# Object Biography

- The twitterbot was created on February 9th, 2018. The bot was created to form an environment for my Cuban Fish model. The bot was made with the CheapBotsDoneQuick web application. 
- Creating an environment for a physical model lead me to ideas of how to encorperate the heritage and culture. Some examples of this can be found with the national anthem, photos of Cubans / Cuba. 
- There are some things lacking however. An example of this is the lack of spanish. I don't speak spanish and preferred to do my work in english. However, a TRUE Cuban bot would probably be done in spanish.
