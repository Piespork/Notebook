# Working with new software
- Ran into a few issues with the reccomended software. Mainly Meshlab. 
- Meshlab does not seem to work properly with either my desktop or laptop, spent a few hours looking up fixes to no avail
- Thankfully, Blender works without a problem! So even though the prof bashed it a bit, i'm willing to give it a try
- Trnio is working as well as expected, was able to make a scan of a classmates face, turned out rather well for the first try.
- Sketchfab seems really easy to work with, uploaded a test model directly from Trnio (a book). 
- The main item i'd love to work on for the rest of the semester is a Thai sword my father owns. 
- A sword model would be fantastic, so many oppertunities to use it within games.
- Another option is to use 2 seperate models, the sheath for it and the sword itself. Perhaps they could interact within a game.
