# Twitter Bot and Class Group Competition

- In class yesterday we were given the chance to form groups and compete for a box of donuts. Best prize for starving univeristy students.
- Our group decided on allowing me the chance to create a twitter bot while they worked on art / twitter / git hub, etc.
- With only an hour and a bit to work on this new technology (i've never personally worked on a twitter bot before) we had our work cut out for ourselves
- Success though! We worked quite well and managed to get a bot working, a logo for out twitter, twitter bio, and a github page for our dinosaur museum.
- The bot originally posted at a rate of 1-tweet-per-10-minutes, so slightly faster than Trump. However, i went back and changed it to twice a day to cut back on the fluff.
- I can honestly say it was some of the most fun i've had in university and has inspired me to create a twitter bot for my second part of the project.
- Originally i wanted to mash up my 3D-model of a fish with perhaps a human (to make a merman), but the twitter bot group work has sent me in a different direction
- My first thoughts for the twitter bot is to cling to the cuban roots of the fish model, therefore bringing something different to the idea of how history can be digitally saved.
- The fish will be given a cuban name and will spit out cuban facts! Places to visit, historical monuments, resorts, culture, etc. Many ideas!
- I will also plan on adding some response features. Nothing too crazy, but basic things. The fishes favourite resort to visit, best rum, perhaps some other facts
- So on one hand, the fish twitter bot is entirely fictional. But on the other hand, the fish twitter bot can be a catalyst for cultural information
- I believe bots like this can be a new, interesting way to provide small bits of information for the newer generations. 
- Combining technology with history and education is a great way to stay relevant.
