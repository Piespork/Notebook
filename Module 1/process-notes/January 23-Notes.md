# Failure Inbound!

- Well the Prof warned us failure would be coming, and here it is!
- Issues arose with my Trnio app, things were not scanning properly
 - I first tried hanging my sword from string, trying to be able to walk around it completly and get a full 3D model
 - The result: the app did not detect the sword! Instead, it only focused on the background. Failure.
 - 3-4 more tries with the sword before I gave up. I believe my efforts are better focused on getting a solid 3D model, instead of the perfect one.
 - Next I tried scanning several larger objects, ranging from an exercising bike, a large wine bottle, tv's, etc.
 - Trnio seems to frown upon larger objects, as they were mostly distorted. Lighting seems to be a large issue.
 - Next I began scanning smaller objects on a small white table, and to my surprise Trnio did not accept the table! Poof! Table does not show up
 - My next complaint about Trnio comes from how the models are generated. They are sent off to a cloud service where they compile before being sent back. 
  - This has made the process of scanning painfully slow. Very frustrating to spend 15-20 minutes waiting on a scan, only for it to come back with an error
 
- HOWEVER! All is not lost! After finding a solid, non-white, surface, and adequate lighting, I was able to successfully create some great 3D models!
- The models, while still a little rough, turned out fantastic. I thankfully was able to get my hands on some statues, antiques, and interesting items.
- I'm unsure how many I need for the project itself, or if we are only focusing on one object, but I uploaded them to Sketchfab where, hopefully later this weekend, I can attempt to fix up using Blender.
- So while failure happens, I was able to learn and believe I can focus on making better models moving forward.

- This is a link to my Sketchfab account, I currently have 4 ROUGH models uploaded. I figure they can sit here before i tidy them up.
