# Module 2 Reflection
- While it was a rather short module, it was important nevertheless. The module focused on copies, alterations, and ethics. The 2 readings for the module helped us understand just how copies of original pieces could be taken by different groups. Some people believe that copies could harm the original. This idea is not new and in fact goes back to ancient times. Some philosophers feared the written word, believing that once something was written down there was no point in it being brought up. The written word has taken away what the spoken word gives. This idea translates to many different topics ranging from archaeology, music, video games, etc. Does the copy truly take away from the original? We learned it is not an easy question, along with how ethics play a role when creating copies. 
- Altertaions is quite similar to creating a copy. In many ways we are making something new, but rely on the original. Also similar to copies, ethics play a role into how something can be altered. We learned that it is not as simple as taking something, changing some data around, and creating something new. As a society we have rules into how altertaions and copyrights protect originality. We then further asked questions like: why should originality be protected? Why can't people copy, mash up, and alter what ever they please? What vaule to copies have compared to original pieces? How many copies become original pieces over time? 
- Tying the project into module 2's questions gives us the oppertunity to experience first hand how copies and alterations affect decisions. For example, mashing an original model with a historal figure (such as Che Guevara) could upset people. These people have problems with alterations to the original (Che) and therefore feel that he should be left alone. Why? Some may argue that it invloves respect, where as others may not have a proper answer. Translating this example to others blurs the line of what could be okay to alter and copy, and what isn't okay. Personally, I believe it is incredibly difficult to judge how copying and altering something could offend some and create ethical problems. This ties into the first module and how we discussed the value of something. A simple mug could mean nothing to one, and everything to another. This subjective appreciation makes it diffcult to accuratley give objects objective value. Therefore, copies that either anger everyone or anger noone become difficult to differentiate. 
- Moving forward we must continue to think about how copies and alterations work. The importance of ethics with mash ups and how the subjective view may impede on new creations.
