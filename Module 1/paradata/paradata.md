# Model Paradata

# History
- The process of module 1 begins with what my overall goal was. Rather than starting with how i will model, or even what I was going to model, it started with the idea that i'd need to digitally translate an object / scene from the real world. 
- From there I could decide on how I would digitally translate an object. Several methods were available, including several digital devices such as an android tablet, a digital camera, iphone, etc. The digital device I went with was an Iphone 6.
- After choosing the device came choosing the technology. In this case I found the app 'Trnio' to be suitable for 3D-modeling. 
- It isnt enough to simply download an application and go; instead, I had to learn the in-and-out of using an app for 3D-modeling. 
- The process of learning a new technology includes problems/failure. Something talked about often in class, not only were we told that we'd fail in different ways, but that failure is good. Similar to how Thomas Edison did not find a single way to create a lightbulb, he found many, many ways to NOT create a lightbulb. 

# Picking A Model
- After learning how to use the technology came time to pick out a proper model. Of course, I wouldn't settle on just the first model I could find. Different situations (such as being inside or outside) played a factor into which model would be chosen. Restricted somewhat by the technology there were some models only working based on a certain lightsource + different colors being more attuned to 3D-modeling.
- Along with the technology, there must be some historical importance to an object. Historical significance seems somewhat subjective as any object with personal meaning could be coaxed into being something historically significant.
- Choosing a sculpture stores the historicial significance of the culture from where it originiantes. No merchant would ever think about having their simple wooden model be apart of a university class somewhere else in the world. The significance comes from the simplicity. Rather than choosing a known person / object, such as a statue from downtown Ottawa, I thought of having culture that could be preserved in some way.

# Modeling
- After deciding on the technology and object comes the actual method of capturing the 3D-model. For this i simply placed the wooden fish on top of my kitchen table, which had a hanging light (since Trino needed great lighting to capture the object properly). This seemed to work fairly well, and presented me with a 3D-model which could then be exported to a website: Sketchfab.

# Cleaning up
- With the model up on Sketchfab my work was 'technically' finished; Sketchfab contains the .obj, .mtl, and texture file for the model. However, I decided to further clean up the model.
- The first attempt at cleaning up the model lead me to Blender, a rather robust software for 3D-modeling. After spending some time learning how to use the software, I went to work on cleaning up the model. However, issues arose when the program needed me to do UV mapping, something that is certainly out of my scope.
- My next attempt lead me to Meshlab, something I had trouble with download originally. Using another computer I was able to quickly learn the software and then clean up the model. 
- Finally happen with my model, I exported it back to Sketchfab.

# Final Notes
- There was much to learn from the process of finding and creating a digital 3D-model. Things are not easy. The process is a rather new form of technology unlike anything else that humans have been capable of. We are now able to find something and capture it. This copy can be either something that defines how others will see it (ie, the original could be destroyed and the copy is all that remains, or it may be the first model of the original that someone sees). 
- I've learned that nothing is perfect and there is still MUCH work to be done in this rising field of digital history.
