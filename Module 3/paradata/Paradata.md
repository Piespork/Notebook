# What Module 3 Is About
- This module was all about immersion. Mainly on how immersive experienses effect our interactions and understanding of history.
- The readings paved a clear path into how we would go about making experiences immersive. A large part of the module focused around video games and the immersive expereince they provide.
- Video games were talked about in great detail, especially in their use of archeology. More so, we had one of the worlds leading experts (Andrew Reinhard) of Archeo-gaming talk to us about the benefits and challenges of anaylzing video games in the context of history. We learned that its a particularly challenging task of creating systems to 'dig' in games. This was reinforcned with Andrew Reinhard's reading about the lack of tools to 'dig' in games.
- Narrative was also incredibly important for us to better understand the passivness and activeness that can be introudced for immersiveness. An example of this is the idea of just looking at objects in a mueseum vs. interacting with objects. We discussed what uses narrative had in video games, as well as how they influence the story.
- The focus of environments let us focus less on objects / images / videos, etc. And more on how how they are used in a context creates new meanings.
- We were told that graphics meant little for video games, and instead the mechanisms and environments played the most important role. This is easy to see because graphics only act as a 'blanket', which can be swapped out without effecting ideas or gameplay. However, the rules and design of the game heavily influence the interactions that can be made. These relationships are the key of providing an immersive experience.

# Twine
- Twine is used to create text based games, similar to 'choose your own adventure'. 
- Why use Twine? Twine can be used to reinforce narratives and challenge the imagination to create text experiences. Be it stories, ways of providing information, etc. Twine allows for creative freedom with incredibly flexability. The easy access also allows for users to jump right in and create whatever stories they want. The ease of access is great for new inspirations to flow and new environments to be explored.
- I am quite terrible with Twine personally, but that is because I lack creativity. So while it is quite easy to use, it goes as far as ones imagination! If I was more creative then I would easily have chosen to use Twine for my project. Instead, I settled on just enjoying the chance to use it in class. By looking over other projects that used Twine it is very easy to see that environments and narrative are rampant in these stories. 

# Connecting Module 3 To My Project
- I decided that my main focus for my project would focus on narrative. The main two points of narrative I enjoyed learning about in module 3 was the passive and active narratives.
- With the 2 narratives in mind I decided to make a twitterbot.
- The passive narrative is fairly straight forward. By just providing information to a user, the passive narrative does not involve interaction. An example of this can be a lecture, a book, and other ways in which there is only a single way of gathering information.
- My project used the passive narrative through regular tweets. Users are able to read the tweets in their normal feeds. This is the standard way of using twitter, and is very passive. The engagment with the tweets is minimal, which may weaken the immersive feeling. However, the benefit of basic tweets is that a user is able to read many without needing to waste time on each one. This allows the users to get through many tweets, which turns twitter into a 'quanity over quality'. 
- The active narrative is much more broad. The key is introducing ways for information to be given by interaction. By interacting with something the user is able to get more feedback and be more immersed.
- The active narrative on twitter is normally done by people interacting with people. However, by creating a twitterbot it will be impossible to have person-to-person interactions. Therefore, my twitterbot will rely on replying to peoples tweets. This is done through CheapBotsDoneQuick beta function. By setting a few key words users are able to tweet at the bot and get a response. This allows for more active participation to get information. This also allows for users to become more immersed into the 'twitterverse'. 


# Twitterbot
- In class we had done an exerecise in which we would create a twitterbot. The website 'CheapBotsDoneQuick' was used to create these bots.
- The first step was to create a new twitter account that would be used for the bot. We then logged into the 'CheapBotsDoneQuick' with our twitter account and could easily make a twitter bot that would post and reply on its own.
- CheapBotsDoneQuick gives very simple instructions on how to begin making the bot. Through faily easy commands we were able to create several groups of responses and tweets that would randomly get chosen.
- For example: tweetModel:{some model1, some model2,...} would contain models that could randomly be chosen to be tweeted.
- I created several groups that includes facts, models, pictures, and the Cuban national anthem.
- The bot is able to cycle through different groups of tweets, allowing for a variety of information for users. 
- The main reason for creating a twitterbot was to make something that could last a long time, provide examples of narratives, and create an immersive environment. Twitter is a VERY large platform that allows for users to explore on their own. They can follow others and enjoy passively, or search for information and interact actively. 


# Final Notes
- Narratives are incredibly important for providing information. A proper narrartive can create a better environment while a poor narrative can ruin the user-information relationship. 
- Video games require tools for further 'digging', and are still a very new technology. Future generations may dig through games similar to how archeologists dig through sites. 
- Graphics dont make the game. A clear set of rules, environments, and relationships are key parts of what makes a game immersive. By applying these features we make games unique, instead of simply 'slapping on another coat of paint'.
