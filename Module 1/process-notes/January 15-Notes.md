# Testing Trnio

- Bought and downloaded Trnio to my Iphone 6. Started testing the 3d modeling. The app itself is easy to figure out.
- I began with a model dragon i bought in Cuba, nothing too large.
- The first model came out rather well for having no idea with how to take 3d model pictures. 
- My first issue however was the trimming tool on the app. It doesnt work. It simply does not trim off what i want it to; or trim anything for that matter.
- My next item was a book. Another simple item
- To my surprise, it came out great, although i was unable to circle the model completley, the details were surprising. 
- Starting class now, hoping to get some better ideas of what to scan, and the best way to scan in general.
